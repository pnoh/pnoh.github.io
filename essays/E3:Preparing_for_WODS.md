The link above, is the link to my Invoice1 WOD in my github, which has an invoice for a sales receipt. As I attempted to perform this WOD, I ran into lots of trouble on my first few tries. In this WOD, apart from big mistakes and things that I simply did not know how to do, I would often put the wrong letter or number in at some point or forget to put in a semi-colon at some point, leaving me to go back and try to figure out where I had gone wrong. The first few tries, I went over the DNF time because of those little mistakes, along side not knowing how to do some things on my own. 
To prepare for the WOD, I essentially did what I had done for the previous BrowserHistory WODs, in which I read through it first and started slowly. My first tries were done with only my preconcieved knowledge and by trying to look up relevent information on how to do the things inside the WOD. After that, is when I watched the solution screencast and saw where I had gone wrong and was able to see what I simply did not know. From there I talor what I do to look a bit more like the solution video and change or omit the things that I had done wrong. At this point, I am able to complete the WOD well within the DNF time.
For the next WOD, I plan to do a similar tactic, but I will focus more on looking for those small mistakes and testing my file while I am going, so I don't spend too much time on that.
